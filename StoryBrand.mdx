# StoryBrand Framework: Startup Games

## 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The Founder, Builder, or Investor who wants to track progress, stay motivated, and compete with peers on the entrepreneurial journey.

**What do they want?**

- Visible progress through their startup journey
- Recognition for achievements and milestones
- Healthy competition with peers
- Motivation to push through difficult phases
- Community and connection with other builders

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)

"Building a startup is a long, often invisible grind. There's no scoreboard, no level-ups, no clear indication that I'm making progress."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)

"It's lonely and demotivating. I don't know if I'm doing well compared to others. I celebrate wins alone and suffer setbacks alone."

### Philosophical Problem

Entrepreneurship is one of the most challenging journeys anyone can take. It deserves to be as engaging and rewarding as a great game—not a solitary slog.

### The Villain

**Invisible Progress & Isolation** — The lack of tangible feedback, recognition, and community that makes the entrepreneurial journey feel like an endless, thankless grind.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)

**Position:** We've built the gamification layer for the startup ecosystem—turning invisible progress into visible achievements.

**Empathy:** We've been founders ourselves. We know the highs and lows, and how much a small win can mean on a hard day.

**Authority:**

- Integrated with startup-builder, sales-builder, and builder.domains
- Real metrics tied to real startup progress
- Community of active founders and builders
- Backed by Startups.Studio portfolio insights

## 4. Plan (The Path)

### Step 1: Connect Your Startup

Link your startup-builder projects to track real progress automatically.

```typescript
import { Games } from 'startup.games'

const player = await Games.connect({
  startup: 'MyStartup',
  player: 'founder@mystartup.com'
})
```

### Step 2: Complete Quests & Earn Achievements

Progress through structured quests and unlock achievements for hitting milestones.

```typescript
// Check available quests
const quests = await player.quests.available()

// Complete a quest
await player.quests.complete('first-customer')

// View achievements
const achievements = await player.achievements.list()
```

### Step 3: Compete & Celebrate

Join competitions, climb leaderboards, and celebrate with the community.

```typescript
// Join a competition
await player.competitions.join('launch-challenge-2024')

// Check your ranking
const rank = await player.leaderboard.rank('mrr')

// Share your wins
await player.celebrate('hit-10k-mrr')
```

## 5. Call to Action

**Transitional CTA:** View Leaderboards at startup.games

## 6. Success (What's at Stake)

**Success looks like:**

- Every milestone feels like an achievement worth celebrating
- Clear visibility into progress compared to peers
- Motivation renewed through gamified challenges
- Community recognition for real accomplishments
- The entrepreneurial journey becomes engaging, not draining

**Transformation:**

From: Grinding alone with no sense of progress
To: Playing a meaningful game with achievements, recognition, and community

## 7. Failure (What We Help Them Avoid)

**Failure looks like:**

- Burnout from the invisible grind
- Giving up before reaching key milestones
- Missing motivation on difficult days
- Building in isolation without community support
- Celebrating wins alone (or not at all)

## 8. Brand Identity

**Voice:** Encouraging, competitive, celebratory

**Tone:** Fun, motivating, community-driven

**Key Messages:**

1. "Turn your startup journey into a game worth playing."
2. "Every milestone is an achievement. Every challenge is a quest."
