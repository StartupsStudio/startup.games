## Problem

<Section variant="problem">

### The Entrepreneurial Grind is Invisible

Building a startup is one of the hardest things you can do:

- **No scoreboard** — You don't know if you're winning or losing
- **Invisible progress** — Months of work with nothing to show
- **Isolated celebration** — Big wins feel small when you're alone
- **Motivation dips** — Hard to push through without feedback
- **No recognition** — Nobody knows how hard you're working

The journey is epic, but it doesn't feel like it.

## Solution

<Section variant="solution">

### What If Building Felt Like Playing?

```typescript
import { Games } from 'startup.games'

const player = await Games.connect({
  startup: 'MyStartup'
})

// 🏆 Achievement Unlocked: First User
// ⚡ +100 XP
// 📈 You moved up 12 spots on the leaderboard!
// 🔥 Streak: 15 days

console.log(player.level)  // Level 12
console.log(player.rank)   // #42 of 1,234 startups
```

Every milestone is an achievement. Every challenge is a quest.

## FAQ

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How do achievements get unlocked?",
      answer: "Achievements unlock automatically when you hit milestones. If you're using startup-builder or sales-builder, progress is tracked automatically. You can also manually log achievements or connect other data sources."
    },
    {
      question: "Are the leaderboards public?",
      answer: "Public leaderboards show rankings without revealing exact numbers unless you opt in. You control what metrics are visible. You can also compete on private leaderboards visible only to your team."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of competitions are there?",
      answer: "We run launch competitions (ship and get users), growth sprints (highest growth rate), shipping marathons (most deploys), and special themed competitions. Some have cash prizes, others offer tools and recognition."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this for my startup studio?",
      answer: "Absolutely. The Studio plan lets you create portfolio-wide leaderboards, run internal competitions, and gamify the entire portfolio experience. Great for keeping founders motivated and creating healthy competition."
    },
    {
      question: "How does team mode work?",
      answer: "Teams combine the XP and achievements of all members. You can compete as a team on team leaderboards and in team competitions. Perfect for co-founders, small teams, or entire companies."
